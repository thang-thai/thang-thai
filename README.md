👋 Hi there! I'm Thang, a passionate software engineer who loves to solve complex problems, leads with empathy, and spreads positivity! 

🛠️ Experienced with building full-stack applications in React/Redux, TypeScript, Node/Express, and SQL/NoSQL databases. 

🔍 Co-creator and active contributor to Palaemon, an open source Kubernetes monitoring and error analysis tool (palaemon.io) focused on helping developers identify out-of-memory (OOMKill) errors.

💬 Recently gave a public talk on Message Brokers as part of SingleSprout's Software Engineering Speaker Series.

:sunny: In my off time, I love staying active (snowboarding, bouldering, or playing volleyball just to name a few). I'm a music enthusiast who strangely enjoys camping in the cold, reading thriller books, teaching my cat tricks, and I'm determined to travel the entire world!
