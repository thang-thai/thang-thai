👋 Hey there, I’m Thang! I’m a full-stack software engineer who thrives on solving complex problems and building scalable, high-impact systems.

💻 I have hands-on experience developing secure applications with React, Angular, and TypeScript on the frontend, and Python, Java/Spring Boot, and .NET on the backend. My work also spans DevOps and platform engineering, where I’ve built and deployed microservices in Kubernetes using Docker and Helm, and provisioned and managed enterprise cloud infrastructure on AWS.

⚙️ At Accelint, I’ve been a key contributor to MBPS, the Navy’s authoritative system of record, where I led technical efforts during its migration to a secure AWS GovCloud environment and developed core software customizations. I also helped build Fortress, a Kubernetes-based PaaS product designed for air-gapped deployment across edge, on-prem, and cloud environments. Previously, I co-developed Palaemon, an open-source Kubernetes developer tool for simulating OOMKill memory failures to help teams fine-tune microservice memory limits before production deployment.

🌍 I lead with empathy, value cross-functional collaboration, and enjoy mentoring. Beyond the keyboard, I’m a lifelong learner, avid traveler, and currently training for my first marathon.

Let’s connect!
