👋 Hey there! I’m Thang, a full-stack software engineer with a passion for solving complex problems and building scalable systems.

💻 My experience spans backend, frontend, and cloud infrastructure. I’ve built secure applications with Java/Spring Boot and .NET, designed user-facing features in React and Angular, and deployed containerized microservices using Docker, Helm, and Kubernetes. I’ve also provisioned and managed cloud-native infrastructure in AWS, with a strong focus on automation, security, and long-term maintainability.

⚙️ At Accelint, I’ve led development across two platforms: <br />
• A Java-based enterprise logistics and configuration management system supporting thousands of systems and users, where I contributed to a full cloud migration, modernized legacy architecture, implemented secure authentication workflows, and improved platform resilience through refactoring legacy reports and automating upgrade pipelines. <br />
• A modular Kubernetes-based PaaS for deploying containerized applications across disconnected, on-prem, and cloud environments. I developed secure access control features, implemented role-based permissions, delivered operational UI improvements, and established full test coverage to ensure reliability and deployment safety.

🛠️ Previously, I co-developed an open-source dev tool for simulating and debugging Kubernetes memory failures, designed to help teams debug resource issues and fine-tune microservice performance before deploying to production.

🌱 I value cross-functional collaboration, lead with empathy, and strive to make every team I join more effective and enjoyable. Beyond the keyboard, I’m a lifelong learner who loves traveling, and I’m currently training for my first marathon. I enjoy exploring new technologies, so let’s connect and chat about them!
